You can include these prompts after the creation in your website by using the <a href="/feedback-fusion/nightly/docs/frontend-library/">frontend-library</a> with the generated <code>promptId</code>.</p><p>Prompts contain the attribute <code>active</code> which defines wether clients can load this prompt when visiting your website. If you included this prompt via the library and its inactive the library would just see the prompt is inactive and won&#39;t do any modifications to your client website, therefore the form does not get injected. We plan more functionalty for the <code>active</code> state in the future (e.g random prompts).</p><h3 id="field" tabindex="-1">Field <a class="header-anchor" href="#field" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Field&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A prompt of course needs fields.
