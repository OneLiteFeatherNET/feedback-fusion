# Feedback-Fusion (WIP)

## What is Feedback-Fusion

Feedback-Fusion is a WIP enterprise ready tool designed to make it easier to 
collect feedback in the web. 
With Feedback-Fusion you can create Survey Prompts and Feedback Fields in an efficent
and easier way with the ability to directly include them in your webpage.

**Key Features:**
- **Support for multiple databases**: Relying on the rbatis ORM Feedback-Fusion has native support 
for a wide range of relational database backends. [List of supported drivers](https://github.com/rbatis/rbatis?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-database-driver)
- **Scalable**: The rust backend works stateless and therefore can be scaled with ease matching to your needs.
- **Easy webintegration**: (Coming soon)
